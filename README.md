# FrontEndLearning

This is my personal repo which I created for learning purposes. I will send here every piece of code, related to my Front End learning.

I've registered on the platform https://www.frontendmentor.io/ which is a platform for learning HTML, CSS, JS basing on real designs, and building real components or pages.

Every challenge from frontendmentor is a seperate folder. Inside the folder you can find my code, designs and styleguides with guidelines for me when it comes to fonts and other details of the builded component.
